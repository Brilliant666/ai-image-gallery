## Sites

| Site | Content | Size | Image license |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: |
| [Portrait](https://photoai.life/portrait/) | Face references for character consistency, filterable by hairstyle | 1,499 | **CC0** |
| [Pose](https://photoai.life/pose/) | Faceless gray mannequin line art, 5 angles per pose | 1,439 | No redistribution |
| [Pose Depth](https://photoai.life/pose-depth/) | Grayscale depth maps of the same poses, for ControlNet | 1,439 | No redistribution |
| [Costume](https://photoai.life/costume/) | Outfits without models, 86 faceted tags | 1,407 items / 4,221 files | No redistribution |
| [Shisei line art](https://photoai.life/shisei/) | Faceless mannequin line art, 4 series × 5 angles; sexy and duo series hidden by default | 280 poses / 1,133 | **CC0** |

Every site has paginated grids, filters and search, a lightbox (`←` `→` to step, `Esc` to close, swipe on touch), original downloads, and theme and language switches. A shared top bar holds the gallery links and the 18+, light / dark and language switches; preferences apply across all galleries. The ⓘ menu at the top right links to the usage guide (`/guide/`), notes and licenses, the GitHub repository and issue tracker. Shortcuts: `1`–`4` switch galleries, `0` goes to the hub, `?` lists all shortcuts, `/` jumps to search. A recipe bar docked at the bottom right collects one portrait, outfit and pose across galleries and generates an image with your own API key (OpenAI GPT Image, Gemini, Doubao Seedream, Qwen-Image or an OpenAI-compatible relay); generation keeps running while you switch galleries. It can also copy an English or Chinese prompt or save a three-panel reference board. Keys and results stay in the browser, which calls the provider directly; adult-oriented items cannot be added. Pose has one switch between line art and depth maps, and the lightbox can compare both with a draggable divider. Adult-oriented items are hidden by default on Pose, Pose Depth, Costume and Shisei; the 18+ switch in the top bar shows them after a one-time age check, shared across all five sites. They never appear on static landing pages or in the sitemap. Each page is a single `index.html` with embedded data and no framework, CDN or web fonts.

> **Portrait and Shisei images are CC0.** The other three sites forbid redistribution. Shisei's pose list follows ai-pose-gallery and is credited only. See `sites/<id>/NOTICE.md`.

## Quick start

This repo contains no image files; `tools/fetch.py` downloads them from each original site. Requires **Python 3.8+**. `tools/mid.py`, which generates lightbox previews, also needs Pillow (`pip install pillow`); every other script uses only the standard library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brilliant666/ai-image-gallery.git
cd ai-image-gallery

python tools/fetch.py      # download all images (~6.8 GB first time, then only missing files)
python tools/mid.py        # generate lightbox previews (~290 MB)
python tools/build.py      # build the five sites and the hub
python tools/release.py    # assemble dist/ (images are hard links, no extra disk)
python tools/serve.py      # preview at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

To try the UI only, run `python tools/fetch.py --tier thumb` to fetch thumbnails (~90 MB).

Check the result through `serve.py`, not by opening `dist/index.html` directly: `file://` differs from `http://` in relative paths, Content-Type and caching.

<details>
<summary>Common commands</summary>

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `python tools/fetch.py --site pose` | Download one site |
| `python tools/mid.py --site portrait` | Generate previews for one site |
| `python tools/verify.py` | Check images: present, size, readable dimensions, previews complete |
| `python tools/build.py --site pose` | Rebuild one site |
| `python tools/build.py --base https://x.com` | Set the public domain for canonical / og / sitemap |
| `python tools/release.py --out <dir>` | Release into another directory |
| `python tools/serve.py --root sites/pose` | Preview one site |
| `python tests/run.py` | Checks that need no images: build output up to date, duplicate ids, inline JS syntax, manifests, doc links (CI runs it on every push) |

`release.py` verifies images first and stops if any are missing (add `--skip-verify` if you fetched only some tiers). It deletes and recreates each target site directory. `--no-images` copies site files only; it does not keep old images in place.

</details>

## Image loading

Each image has three tiers: thumbnails for the grid, previews for the lightbox, originals for download only.

| Tier | Portrait | Pose | Pose Depth | Costume |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Thumbnail | ~20 KB | ~17 KB | ~11 KB | ~10 KB |
| Preview | ~150 KB | ~33 KB | ~10 KB | ~90 KB |
| Original | ~3.2 MB | ~450 KB | ~95 KB | ~1 MB |

- The lightbox shows the sharp thumbnail at once and fades in the preview when it arrives. Switching images hides the previous one immediately.
- Previews are prefetched after 120 ms of hover, on pointer down, or on keyboard focus; once open, the next and previous images are prefetched too.
- Costume previews come from the original site. The other three are generated by `tools/mid.py` (longest edge 1600 px, WebP quality 82). If a preview is missing, the lightbox falls back to the original.

Measured on the Portrait site at 1.5 MB/s and 150 ms latency: a direct click shows the preview after about 0.6 s; after hovering for about 1 s, the preview shows as soon as the lightbox opens.

## Deployment

Point the web root at `dist/`. It is flat (`index.html` + `portrait/` + `pose/` + …), so the hub's relative links work without nginx `alias`.

```bash
# Server update: drops build output; stops and lists any hand-edited files instead of overwriting them
python3 tools/update.py
python3 tools/mid.py
python3 tools/build.py --base https://your-domain
python3 tools/release.py --out dist-stage   # stage first, check, then swap sites into dist/ atomically
```

First-time setup, nginx, atomic swaps and rollback: [deploy/DEPLOY.md](deploy/DEPLOY.md) (Chinese).

## Project layout

```

Images stay out of git: 6.8 GB of binaries would make every clone huge, and most site licenses do not allow it. `release.py` hard-links 20,751 image files into `dist/`, which costs no extra disk on the same file system.
